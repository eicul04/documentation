### 1.5 Overview

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision
PlaceToBeer is a webbased platform to propose and rate places and events in your friend group. The idea is to individually rate bars, pubs, clubs, restaurants or wherever you can have fun together located in Karlsruhe.

In the webapp you can create and manage groups with different users. All users should be able to submit newly discovered places to hang out. Each group member can rate places so "best-of" lists can be generated. Automatic suggestions can be generated based on ratings and set filters. After the visit, every member can give a further and more specific rating, which serves to fill another "best-of" list.
